## Summary:

### Data Analysis Key Findings

*   **Dataset Structure and Completeness**: The dataset comprises 1000 entries and 8 columns. It contains 5 categorical columns (`gender`, `race/ethnicity`, `parental level of education`, `lunch`, `test preparation course`) and 3 numerical columns (`math score`, `reading score`, `writing score`). Critically, the initial inspection and missing value analysis confirmed that there are **no missing values** across any of the columns.
*   **Descriptive Statistics for Scores**:
    *   **Average Performance**: Students, on average, performed slightly better in reading (mean: ~69.17) than in writing (mean: ~68.05) and math (mean: ~66.09).
    *   **Score Distribution**: The standard deviations for all three scores are similar (~14.60 to ~15.20), indicating comparable variability in performance across subjects.
    *   **Extreme Scores**: While all subjects had students achieving a perfect score of 100, the minimum math score was 0, and the minimum reading and writing scores were 17 and 10, respectively.
*   **Outlier Detection and Handling**:
    *   **Outlier Counts**: Using the IQR method, 8 outliers were detected in 'math score', 6 in 'reading score', and 5 in 'writing score'.
    *   **Handling Strategy**: Outliers were handled by **capping** them to their respective IQR lower and upper bounds (e.g., 'math score' values below 27.0 were set to 27.0, and above 107.0 were set to 107.0). This approach preserved all 1000 rows, ensuring data integrity while mitigating the impact of extreme values.
    *   **Impact of Capping**: The minimum values of the numerical scores were adjusted to their lower bounds (e.g., 'math score' minimum became 27.0, 'reading score' became 29.0, 'writing score' became 25.875).
*   **Correlation Analysis**:
    *   **Strong Positive Correlations**: All numerical scores exhibit strong positive correlations, suggesting high interdependence.
        *   **Reading Score and Writing Score** showed the highest correlation at **0.95**, indicating a very strong linear relationship.
        *   **Math Score and Reading Score** correlated at **0.82**.
        *   **Math Score and Writing Score** correlated at **0.80**.
    *   **Absence of Negative Correlations**: No significant negative correlations were observed among the scores.

### Insights or Next Steps

*   The high positive correlations between all three subjects (especially between reading and writing) suggest a common underlying factor influencing overall academic performance. Further analysis could explore demographic or socioeconomic factors within the categorical variables to identify specific student groups that might benefit from targeted interventions.
*   The presence of low scores, particularly a minimum 'math score' of 0, even after outlier capping, indicates that a segment of students might be struggling significantly. Further investigation into the characteristics of these low-performing students could inform educational support strategies.
